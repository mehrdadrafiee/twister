# twister
a web app to test the twitter API.

- Briefly describe your teamâ€™s project

- Research and compile a list of APIs that might be useful for your project

There are lots of API that we can use in out project, but due to the Twitter policy change in Jun 2013, almost all of APIs need OAuth. Which means, we can not use them without authentication in out app.

	- Twitter Custom PHP API: This API is very useful since it provides 2 options to search for tweets. one is using the keyword search, and the other one is using a username.

	- Twitter RESTfl API: This API needs authentication.

	- Twitcher API: This API does not require authentication, however you have to sing in with your twitter account to use the API.

	- anyorigin: Which basically converts the url to a JSON method. Useful but needs purchase.

- For each API, briefly describe how its functionality might be used in your project

- Choose one API from your list and create an example web page using jQuery AJAX to call the API and display the returned results

- Describe why you chose that particular API and provide a link to its documentation

- Discuss any potential issues that you can foresee with using this API in your project

- Evaluate your experience creating the example web page and make a recommendation of whether your team should use this API or keep looking for better options

- Describe how the example you wrote might be expanded to use additional functionality provided by the API
